# Challenge Project: Company Home Page with Flexbox

## Project Goals
In this Codecademy project, I was tasked to utilize flexbox to design and build the layout for a company’s homepage - either an existing company or a fictional one.

## Description
I chose to create a fictional art gallery company called Moonimo (named after my two cats Mooni and Mochi). While browsing Google for inspiration, I discovered [Mooni](https://moonigallery.com/) - an actual art gallery with its own homepage. Following the guidelines of this project, I took most of my design inspiration from Mooni's website to create my own simplified version of their homepage while using flexbox. 

## Project Requirements
1. A title and logo or splash image.
2. A mission statement or brief description of the company.
3. A list or set of images and titles representing the product or products of the company.
4. A section describing some of the company’s employees or teammates.
5. Flexbox styling for layout.
6. Custom styles for other properties, such as colors, fonts, and other layout properties such as borders and padding.
